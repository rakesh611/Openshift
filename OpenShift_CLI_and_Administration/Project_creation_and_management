üß± What is a Project in OpenShift
In OpenShift, a Project = a Kubernetes Namespace + additional OpenShift metadata (like resource quotas, role bindings, etc.).
Each project isolates workloads and defines who can access what.

üß∞ Project Creation and Management Commands

üîπ 1. Create a new project
oc new-project <project-name>

Example:
oc new-project demo-app

Output:
Now using project "demo-app" on server "https://api.ocp.example.com:6443".
You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command.

What happens:
Creates a new namespace.
Sets it as the current working project.
Adds default service accounts and roles (e.g., builder, deployer, default).

üîπ 2. List all projects
oc get projects

Example Output:
NAME             DISPLAY NAME   STATUS
default                         Active
kube-system                     Active
demo-app                        Active
monitoring                      Active

üîπ 3. Switch to another project
oc project <project-name>

Example:
oc project monitoring

Output:
Now using project "monitoring" on server "https://api.ocp.example.com:6443".

üîπ 4. Describe a project
oc describe project <project-name>

Example:
oc describe project demo-app

Output:
Name:           demo-app
Display Name:
Status:         Active
Annotations:    openshift.io/description=
                openshift.io/display-name=
Created:        3 minutes ago

üîπ 5. Delete a project
oc delete project <project-name>

Example:
oc delete project demo-app

Output:
project.project.openshift.io "demo-app" deleted

üîπ 6. View the current active project
oc project

Output:
Using project "monitoring" on server "https://api.ocp.example.com:6443".
üßë‚Äçüíº Administrator-Level Project Management

Administrators can:
Set resource quotas for a project.
Assign role-based access control (RBAC).
Define network policies between projects.
Configure limit ranges and default storage classes.

Example: View quotas
oc get quota -n demo-app

Example: View role bindings
oc get rolebindings -n demo-app
