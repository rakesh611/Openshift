🚀 OpenShift Installation Types — Detailed Explanation
OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) can be installed in three major ways, 
depending on how much infrastructure automation you want Red Hat’s installer to handle:
| Type                      | Full Form                            | Who provisions infra?    | Automation Level | Typical Use Case                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IPI**                   | Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure | OpenShift Installer      | High             | Public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP), Red Hat Virtualization |
| **UPI**                   | User-Provisioned Infrastructure      | You (admin/user)         | Manual / Custom  | On-prem bare metal, custom VM setups                    |
| **Single-node / Compact** | Minimal cluster setup                | Either user or installer | Low to moderate  | Edge, dev/test, PoC environments                        |

🧩 1️⃣ IPI — Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure
🔹 What It Is
IPI means the OpenShift Installer automatically provisions all infrastructure — including:
Virtual machines or cloud instances
Networking (VPCs, subnets, load balancers)
DNS records
Storage (EBS, Azure Disks, etc.)
Bootstrap, master, and worker nodes
This is a fully automated installation process where the installer controls both:
Cluster creation
Infrastructure provisioning

🔹 Example: AWS IPI Installation Flow
Run the installer:
./openshift-install create cluster --dir=mycluster

Provide:
AWS credentials
Cluster name
Base domain (e.g., example.com)
The installer automatically:
Creates VPC, subnets, security groups
Deploys EC2 instances for control plane and workers
Creates Load balancers for API & ingress traffic
Configures Route53 DNS records
Deploys the OpenShift cluster (masters, workers, bootstrap)

After install, destroy cluster easily:
./openshift-install destroy cluster --dir=mycluster

🔹 Advantages
✅ Fast and simple (minimal manual steps)
✅ Fully automated provisioning and teardown
✅ Best for cloud environments
✅ Red Hat officially supports this on AWS, Azure, GCP, vSphere, OpenStack

🔹 Disadvantages
❌ Limited customization (network, storage, topology)
❌ Harder to integrate with existing corporate infra
❌ Not ideal for air-gapped or bare-metal setups

🔹 Best Use Cases
Public cloud environments
Dev/test clusters where speed matters
Standardized production environments with no custom networking

⚙️ 2️⃣ UPI — User-Provisioned Infrastructure
🔹 What It Is
In UPI, you (the user or admin) manually prepare the infrastructure — including all VMs, load balancers, DNS, and storage — before running the OpenShift installer.
The installer then only installs OpenShift components, not the infra itself.
This approach gives full control and is mandatory for bare metal or highly customized environments.

🔹 UPI Architecture Flow
You create:
Load balancers for:
api (port 6443)
api-int (internal API)
*.apps.<domain> (ingress apps)
DNS entries (for api, api-int, and apps)

Virtual machines:
1 Bootstrap
3 Masters (control plane)
N Workers (optional)
Configure networking (routes, subnets, VLANs)

Extract ignition configs:
./openshift-install create manifests --dir=install_dir
./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir=install_dir

Boot each VM with its respective ignition file:
bootstrap.ign
master.ign
worker.ign

Monitor installation:
./openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete --dir=install_dir
./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --dir=install_dir

🔹 Advantages
✅ Full control over networking, storage, and hardware
✅ Works in air-gapped or disconnected environments
✅ Suitable for bare-metal and on-prem virtualization (KVM, VMware, etc.)
✅ Custom security, load balancer, or DNS setups

🔹 Disadvantages
❌ More complex and time-consuming
❌ Higher risk of misconfiguration
❌ Requires solid knowledge of networking, DNS, and infra provisioning

🔹 Best Use Cases
Bare-metal installations
Custom VM setups (e.g., KVM, VirtualBox, VMM)
Secure, air-gapped datacenters (no internet access)
Integrating with existing enterprise network and storage

🧠 3️⃣ Single-Node / Compact Clusters
OpenShift also supports lightweight topologies for edge, PoC, or development environments.

🧩 (a) Single Node OpenShift (SNO)
A single machine runs all OpenShift components:
Control plane (API, etcd, scheduler, controller-manager)
Worker (application pods)
Effectively a full cluster in one node.

🔹 SNO Architecture
+-------------------------------------------+
| Single Node                               |
|-------------------------------------------|
| etcd + API Server + Controller + Scheduler |
| + Kubelet + CRI-O + Application Pods       |
+-------------------------------------------+

🔹 Advantages
✅ Minimal hardware (only one system)
✅ Ideal for edge/remote sites
✅ Quick PoC or developer sandbox
✅ Full OCP feature set (except HA)

🔹 Disadvantages
❌ No high availability (single point of failure)
❌ Limited scalability
❌ Limited resources for workloads

🔹 Typical Hardware (minimum)
8 vCPUs
32 GB RAM
120 GB disk

🧩 (b) Compact Cluster (3-node Cluster)
Here, the control plane (masters) and worker roles are combined on the same three nodes.
No separate worker nodes — each master also schedules workloads.

🔹 Compact Cluster Architecture
3 nodes (control + worker)
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Master+Worker1 │ Master+Worker2 │ Master+Worker3 │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

🔹 Advantages
✅ Smaller footprint than full (3+3) clusters
✅ HA for control plane (3 etcd members)
✅ Ideal for edge datacenters or small sites

🔹 Disadvantages
❌ Limited scaling — not for large workloads
❌ Shared CPU/memory between control and app pods

🔹 Typical Hardware
Each node:
8+ vCPUs
32–64 GB RAM
120 GB+ disk
