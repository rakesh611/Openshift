üîí Default ‚Äúdeny-all‚Äù and ‚Äúallow‚Äù network policies in OpenShift
OpenShift (like Kubernetes) uses NetworkPolicy resources to control pod-to-pod and pod-to-external traffic within the same namespace or across namespaces.
By default, OpenShift allows all traffic between pods until you apply any NetworkPolicy ‚Äî after that, only the traffic explicitly allowed is permitted.

üß© 1. Default Behavior (Before Any NetworkPolicy)
Situation	Behavior
No NetworkPolicy exists in a namespace	‚úÖ All pods can communicate with each other (default allow-all).
Pods can talk across namespaces	‚úÖ Allowed by default (no restrictions).
Ingress/Egress from outside the cluster	‚úÖ Allowed, depending on the service exposure (Route, Ingress, NodePort, etc.).
So, by default, OpenShift is ‚Äúallow-all.‚Äù

üõë 2. Applying a ‚ÄúDefault Deny-All‚Äù Policy
When you apply any NetworkPolicy in a namespace, OpenShift SDN (or OVN-Kubernetes) starts enforcing rules.
If you create a deny-all policy, it will block all incoming and/or outgoing traffic until other allow rules are defined.

Example: Deny-All Ingress and Egress Policy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: my-app
spec:
  podSelector: {}  # Selects all pods
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
Effect:
‚ùå No pod in my-app namespace can receive or send traffic.
‚úÖ Only the API server (control plane) and DNS are still allowed internally by system rules.
‚úÖ 3. Allow-All Policy (Reverting the Deny-All)

If you later want to open all traffic again, you can apply an allow-all policy.

Allow-All Ingress:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all-ingress
  namespace: my-app
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - {}  # allow all sources
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress

Allow-All Egress:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all-egress
  namespace: my-app
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  egress:
  - {}  # allow all destinations
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
Effect:
‚úÖ All traffic (incoming and outgoing) is allowed again.
This is equivalent to having no NetworkPolicy at all.

‚öôÔ∏è 4. Common Default Policies Used in Projects
When setting up a secure namespace, administrators often create:
| Policy Name             | Purpose                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `deny-all`              | Start with no communication ‚Äî baseline for zero trust. |
| `allow-same-namespace`  | Allow only pods within the same namespace.             |
| `allow-dns`             | Allow access to cluster DNS service.                   |
| `allow-egress-external` | Allow only specific external destinations.             |

Example (allow same-namespace only):

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
  namespace: my-app
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}  # allow from same namespace pods
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress

| Stage                  | Description                    | Default Behavior |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| No NetworkPolicy       | All traffic allowed            | ‚úÖ                |
| After Deny-All Policy  | All traffic blocked            | ‚ùå                |
| After Allow Policy     | Only specified traffic allowed | ‚öôÔ∏è               |
| After Allow-All Policy | All traffic allowed again      | ‚úÖ                |

üß© 6. OpenShift-Specific Note
OpenShift‚Äôs default SDN or OVN-Kubernetes implements NetworkPolicies natively.
Projects (namespaces) can have pre-configured policies like:
default-deny-ingress
default-deny-egress
These are often auto-applied in security-hardened environments (e.g., through templates or compliance profiles).
