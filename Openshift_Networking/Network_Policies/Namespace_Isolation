üß© What is Namespace Isolation in OpenShift?
By default in OpenShift (and Kubernetes):
All pods across all namespaces (projects) can talk to each other.
There‚Äôs no isolation between namespaces unless you enforce it.

Namespace Isolation means:
‚ÄúPods in one namespace cannot communicate with pods in another namespace unless explicitly allowed.‚Äù
This is achieved using NetworkPolicies.

‚öôÔ∏è How NetworkPolicies Enforce Namespace Isolation
NetworkPolicies control:
Ingress: who can send traffic to your pods.
Egress: where your pods can send traffic to.
When you create a deny-all policy in a namespace, you effectively isolate that namespace‚Äôs pods from others.
Then, you selectively allow communication only within the same namespace or to specific other namespaces.

üö´ Step 1 ‚Äî Deny All Traffic (Start with Isolation)

Create a deny-all policy in each namespace that you want to isolate.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: team-a
spec:
  podSelector: {}   # Selects all pods
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
Effect:
‚ùå Pods in team-a cannot talk to pods in any namespace.
‚ùå No one can talk to team-a pods.
‚úÖ DNS and control-plane traffic still works (managed by cluster).
This creates strong namespace isolation.

‚úÖ Step 2 ‚Äî Allow Traffic Within the Same Namespace

You may want pods in the same namespace to communicate (for example, frontend ‚Üî backend within team-a).

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
  namespace: team-a
spec:
  podSelector: {}   # Applies to all pods
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}   # Allows from all pods in same namespace
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
Effect:
‚úÖ Pods in team-a can talk to each other.
‚ùå Still blocked from talking to other namespaces.
Now the namespace is internally open but externally isolated.

üåê Step 3 ‚Äî Allow Communication Between Specific Namespaces
If you need controlled cross-namespace access (for example, team-a backend connects to database namespace), you can explicitly allow it.

Example: Allow traffic from team-a to database namespace

In the database namespace:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-team-a
  namespace: database
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: team-a
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
Add the label to the namespace:
oc label namespace team-a name=team-a

Effect:
‚úÖ Only pods from namespace team-a can connect to pods labeled role=db in database namespace.
‚ùå Other namespaces remain blocked.

üß† Step 4 ‚Äî Allow Egress to External Services (Optional)
You can also allow specific egress traffic ‚Äî for example, allowing external internet or DNS resolution.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-external
  namespace: team-a
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
Effect: Pods in team-a can reach the Internet.

üß© Combined Architecture
Here‚Äôs what the namespace isolation setup looks like:
+----------------------+        +----------------------+
| Namespace: team-a    |        | Namespace: team-b    |
|----------------------|        |----------------------|
| pods <----> pods ‚úÖ   |        | pods <----> pods ‚úÖ   |
| cross-namespace ‚ùå    |        | cross-namespace ‚ùå    |
| optional external ‚úÖ  |        | optional external ‚úÖ  |
+----------------------+        +----------------------+
          ‚ùå
    no cross-traffic

üß∞ OpenShift Tools for Network Isolation
In OpenShift, you can manage these policies using:
oc apply -f <policy>.yaml
oc get networkpolicies -n <namespace>
oc describe networkpolicy <policy-name>

If you use OpenShift Web Console:
Go to Project ‚Üí Network Policies ‚Üí Create Policy
Visualize pod connectivity using the Topology View ‚Äî OpenShift UI will show blocked/allowed paths between pods.

‚úÖ Summary
| Step | Policy                  | Purpose                                      |
| ---- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `deny-all`              | Block all communication (isolation baseline) |
| 2    | `allow-same-namespace`  | Allow pods in same namespace                 |
| 3    | `allow-from-namespace`  | Allow traffic from specific namespaces       |
| 4    | `allow-egress-external` | Allow external communication                 |
