ðŸ”¹ 1. Overview of L4 and L7
| Layer  | OSI Layer                      | What is Balanced                                                | Example in OpenShift                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **L4** | Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)      | Balances traffic based on **IP + Port**                         | NodePort, LoadBalancer service               |
| **L7** | Application Layer (HTTP/HTTPS) | Balances traffic based on **HTTP headers, host, path, cookies** | HAProxy Ingress Controller, OpenShift Routes |
Key difference: L4 is transport-level, L7 is application-level.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Layer 4 (L4) Load Balancing
How It Works:
Distributes traffic using TCP/UDP 5-tuple: source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol.
Does not inspect HTTP content.
Usually implemented using kube-proxy / SDN, NodePort, or external cloud LB at L4.
OpenShift Example:

Service type LoadBalancer or NodePort:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-l4
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080

Traffic flow:

[Client IP:Port]
      |
      v
[LoadBalancer IP / NodePort]
      |
      v
[Service ClusterIP]
      |
      v
[Pod: myapp]
Features:
Fast, lightweight
Works for all TCP/UDP traffic, not just HTTP
No content inspection â†’ cannot do path-based routing, SSL termination at L4 is limited

ðŸ”¹ 3. Layer 7 (L7) Load Balancing
How It Works:
Operates at HTTP/HTTPS layer.
Can inspect:
Host headers â†’ example.com
URL paths â†’ /api, /static
Cookies / session info â†’ sticky sessions
Routes traffic to different services based on rules.

OpenShift Example:
Route using HAProxy Ingress:

apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: myapp-l7
spec:
  host: myapp.apps.cluster.local
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: myapp
  tls:
    termination: edge

Traffic flow:

[Client: HTTPS]
      |
      v
[HAProxy Ingress Pod]  <-- L7 inspection
      |  host/path routing
      v
[Service ClusterIP]
      |
      v
[Pods: myapp]
Features:
Supports TLS termination at ingress
Path-based routing: /api â†’ service A, /static â†’ service B
Host-based routing: app1.example.com â†’ service A
Sticky sessions for session persistence

| Feature         | L4 Load Balancing                  | L7 Load Balancing                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Layer           | Transport (TCP/UDP)                | Application (HTTP/HTTPS)              |
| Criteria        | IP + port                          | HTTP headers, paths, cookies          |
| TLS Termination | Not handled (pass-through)         | Yes, at ingress                       |
| Routing         | Port-based only                    | Path-based, host-based, content-based |
| Service Types   | NodePort, LoadBalancer             | Routes, Ingress (HAProxy)             |
| Use Case        | DB traffic, TCP services, UDP apps | Web apps, APIs, microservices         |

ðŸ”¹ 5. When to Use L4 vs L7
L4 Load Balancing:
Database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
TCP-based protocols (SMTP, MQTT)
When speed and simplicity are critical

L7 Load Balancing:
HTTP/S web applications
Microservices with multiple endpoints
Need for TLS termination, routing by URL/host
Session persistence required

ðŸ”¹ 6. OpenShift Integration
| Type | OpenShift Component                | Example                                            |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| L4   | NodePort / LoadBalancer service    | Expose PostgreSQL, Redis, or custom TCP service    |
| L7   | HAProxy Ingress Controller + Route | Expose web apps, REST APIs with TLS & path routing |

Diagram Summary:
L4:
[Client TCP] --> [NodePort/LoadBalancer] --> [Service ClusterIP] --> [Pod]

L7:
[Client HTTP/HTTPS] --> [HAProxy Ingress] --> [Route/Path Rules] --> [Service ClusterIP] --> [Pod]

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
L4 is simple, fast, transport-level load balancing (TCP/UDP).
L7 is smart, application-level, handles HTTP/HTTPS, TLS, and routing rules.
OpenShift uses NodePort / LoadBalancer for L4 and HAProxy Ingress Controller + Routes for L7.
Choosing between L4 vs L7 depends on protocol type and routing requirements.
