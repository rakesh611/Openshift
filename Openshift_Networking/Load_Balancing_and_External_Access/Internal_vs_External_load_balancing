ðŸ”¹ 1. What Is Load Balancing in OpenShift?
Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple pods or services to:
Ensure high availability
Improve performance
Avoid single points of failure
OpenShift supports both internal and external load balancing depending on whether traffic originates inside the cluster or from outside clients.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Internal Load Balancing
Definition: Load balancing traffic within the cluster, between pods or services.

Characteristics:
| Feature           | Description                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scope             | Cluster-internal (pod-to-pod, service-to-service)                  |
| Uses              | Kubernetes Service type **ClusterIP**, OpenShift Routes (internal) |
| DNS               | CoreDNS resolves service name to ClusterIP                         |
| Load Balancer     | OpenShift SDN or OVN-Kubernetes handles routing to endpoints       |
| Traffic entry     | Pods or services inside cluster                                    |
| High Availability | Automatically handled by kube-proxy / SDN                          |
Example:

Service of type ClusterIP:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: demo
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - port: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
Internal pods query backend.demo.svc.cluster.local
CoreDNS resolves â†’ ClusterIP â†’ SDN routes to one of the pods.

Flow:
[Pod: frontend]
    |
    v
[ClusterIP Service: backend]
    |
    v
[Pod: backend-1 / backend-2]
Internal load balancing is automatic; no external IP or LoadBalancer required.

ðŸ”¹ 3. External Load Balancing
Definition: Load balancing traffic from outside the cluster (internet or data center) to OpenShift services.

Characteristics:
| Feature       | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope         | External clients (internet / on-prem network)                 |
| Uses          | Service type **LoadBalancer**, OpenShift **Ingress / Routes** |
| Load Balancer | Cloud LB (AWS ELB, GCP LB) or MetalLB (bare-metal)            |
| Traffic entry | NodePort or external IP                                       |
| DNS           | External DNS resolves to LB IP or Route hostname              |
| TLS           | Termination at LoadBalancer / HAProxy ingress                 |

Example: LoadBalancer Service

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
Cloud LB â†’ assigns external IP automatically
Bare-metal LB â†’ MetalLB provides external IP
External users access http://<EXTERNAL-IP> â†’ traffic routed to pods

Example: Route with HAProxy

apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: myapp-route
spec:
  host: myapp.apps.cluster.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: myapp
  tls:
    termination: edge
HAProxy ingress balances HTTP/S traffic to service pods
Supports TLS termination, path/host routing

| Aspect            | Internal Load Balancing          | External Load Balancing                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Source of traffic | Pods/services inside cluster     | External clients (internet/office network) |
| Service type      | ClusterIP, Headless              | LoadBalancer, NodePort, Route              |
| IP                | ClusterIP (virtual)              | External IP / DNS hostname                 |
| DNS               | Internal CoreDNS                 | Public DNS / Route hostname                |
| LB Mechanism      | OpenShift SDN / kube-proxy       | Cloud LB, MetalLB, HAProxy Ingress         |
| TLS               | Optional, pod-to-pod             | Commonly used at ingress / route level     |
| Use case          | Service-to-service communication | Expose applications to external users      |

ðŸ”¹ 6. Best Practices
Use ClusterIP for internal services â€” simple and automatic load balancing.
Use LoadBalancer / Routes for external access â€” ensures HA and scaling.
MetalLB for bare-metal clusters â€” assign external IPs safely.
Integrate with DNS â€” internal CoreDNS for pods, external DNS for users.
Monitor endpoints â€” OpenShift automatically updates pods in the service, but always check with:
oc get endpoints <service-name> -n <namespace>

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
Internal Load Balancing â†’ pod-to-pod, ClusterIP, automatic via SDN/CoreDNS.
External Load Balancing â†’ external users, LoadBalancer service or Route, HAProxy ingress or MetalLB for bare-metal.
Both mechanisms ensure scalability, reliability, and high availability, but serve different traffic origins.
